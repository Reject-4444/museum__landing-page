**Project Description:**

**museum__landing-page** is a visually engaging and responsive landing page created using HTML and Sass, incorporating the Block Element Modifier (BEM) methodology for efficient and structured styling. The page serves as an immersive introduction to a museum, offering visitors a glimpse into the institution's unique collections and events.

The implementation of Sass, coupled with BEM, has streamlined the styling process, allowing for more maintainable and organized CSS code. Leveraging adaptive mixins and grid systems, the landing page seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.
